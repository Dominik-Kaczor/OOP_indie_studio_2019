Introduction
============

The aim of the Indie Studio is to implement a cross-platform 3D video game with real-world tools.

The game we must implement is a Bomberman-like game.
Bomberman is one of the most famous video games of all time.
With over 70 franchises, ranging from the first version on MSX, ZX Spectrum and Sharp MZ-700 in 1983
to the lastest versions on modern consoles, over 10 million units have been sold.
Our gameplay reference is Neo Bomberman, released on the Neo Geo and MVS systems in 1997.

Here’s the required features :

• Local multi-player with the possibility the play with a friend + AI’s controlled bots.
• A main game menu (to start a new game or load an existing one).
• Our game must feature 3D graphics but a 2D gameplay.
• Our game must feature procedurally generated maps.
• Save/Load a game
• Animation and sounds to give life to the game (especially during various interactions)
• Think about bomb explosion, player walking, background music, . . .
• Some Power-ups
• Bomb Up
• Speed Up
• Fire Up
• Wall Pass
